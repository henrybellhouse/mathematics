# Computational Mathematics

This code has been developed from problem sets in CS50 from Harvard University.

Problems have been selected for their subject matter and relevancy in mathematics.

## Topics

### Factorial

This program takes a numerical input and calculates its factorial using recursion.

### Primes

Taking an upper and lower bound, this program locates and outputs all primes in the provided range. The values in are included in the range.

### Triangle Test

Given user generated values, this algorithm tests the lengths against triangle rules to establish if a triangle can be made from these values.
